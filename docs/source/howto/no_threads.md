# Limit the number of threads used by `immunarch` (DuckDB)

## What is happening under the hood?

`immunarch` uses `immundata`, which uses `duckplyr`, which runs queries in **DuckDB**. It is quite a journey from the data to your plots. 

DuckDB can use many CPU cores by default to run faster, but sometimes you want to limit this.

## Why limit threads?

* On shared machines (servers, CI), many threads can slow down other users.
* In tutorials, fewer threads make examples more predictable and easier to reproduce.
* Lower threads = lower CPU load (but slower queries).

## How to limit the number of threads

Put this near the start of your tutorial/script:

=== "R"

    ```r
    # Limit the number of CPU threads used by DuckDB in this R session
    duckplyr::db_exec("SET threads TO 1")
    ```

Change later (example: use 4 threads) or reset to default:

=== "R"

    ```r
    duckplyr::db_exec("SET threads TO 4")   # use 4 threads
    # or, if supported in your environment:
    duckplyr::db_exec("RESET threads")      # back to DuckDB default
    ```
